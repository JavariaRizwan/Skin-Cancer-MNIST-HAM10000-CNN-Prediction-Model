# 🧠 Skin Cancer MNIST – HAM10000 CNN Model
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin cancer lesion images using the HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images) dataset released by Harvard University. The model supports early detection and research in computer-aided dermatology.

# 📂 Dataset

HAM10000 / Skin Cancer MNIST
~10,000 dermatoscopic images
7 classes of pigmented skin lesions: Melanoma | Melanocytic nevi | Basal cell carcinoma | Actinic keratoses | Benign keratosis | Dermatofibroma | Vascular lesions

# ⚙️ Model Overview
**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** | **Image preprocessing (resizing & normalization)** | **Data augmentation** | **Softmax-based multi-class classification**

# 🚀 Features
Automated skin lesion classification | End-to-end training pipeline | Model evaluation using accuracy and loss | Extendable for deployment and optimization


# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python | TensorFlow / Keras | NumPy & Pandas | Matplotlib

# 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate the application of deep learning in healthcare, focusing on skin cancer detection and medical image analysis.
