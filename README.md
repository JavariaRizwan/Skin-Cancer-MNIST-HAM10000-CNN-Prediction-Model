# Skin-Cancer-MNIST-HAM10000-CNN-Prediction-Model
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin cancer lesion images from the HAM10000 dataset released by Harvard University. The model identifies different pigmented skin lesions, supporting early detection and research in computer-aided dermatology.
